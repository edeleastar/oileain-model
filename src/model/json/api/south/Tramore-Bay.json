Parking is at the beach.  The beach surfs well in SWs, which makes it one of gthe more dependable locations in the country.  The “<em>trá mór</em>” itself is the long beach E of the town under the high sandhills of the Burrow, beautiful to walk, and very popular. Reminiscent of a <em>machaire</em> system, which it isn’t, technically, Tramore inner bay has all the attractions of such inner bays everywhere, strictly for the purist.  Parking for the inner bay is at S628-006 on its E side, many miles E by road from Tramore itself.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
