Landing is possible on a sandy beach at the NW side of the bay. At HW the beach is all but covered. Best landing is at the W end of the beach. A chart is a lot more suitable than an OS map to delineate the approach reefs and skerries. Long Rock W773-528 is very prominent, with good breakers. There is parking just above the beach.</p>\n","costalZone":"**The South Coast**"}
